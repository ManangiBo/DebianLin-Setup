1. Open your preferred text editor and create a new file. You can name it anything you want, for example, `open_terminal.sh`.
2. Add the following lines to the file:
    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    konsole
    ```
This script will open the default terminal emulator for KDE, which is `konsole`. If you prefer to use a different terminal emulator, replace `konsole` with the command to open your preferred emulator.

3. Save the file in a directory of your choice. For example, you can save it in your home directory.
4. Make the script executable by running the following command in the terminal:
    ```
    chmod +x ~/open_terminal.sh
    ```
5. Now you need to create a custom keyboard shortcut to run the script. Open the KDE System Settings and go to Shortcuts > Active Manager.
6. Click on the "Add custom shortcut" button at the bottom left corner of the window and select "New > Global Shortcut > Command/URL".
7. In the "Trigger" tab, click on the "None" button and press the `Ctrl+T` keys.
8. In the "Action" tab, enter the full path to the script you just created. For example, if you saved the script in your home directory, the path would be `/home/your_username/open_terminal.sh`.
9. Click "Apply" and your new keyboard shortcut is now set up.


From now on, whenever you press `Ctrl+T`, the terminal emulator should open automatically.
