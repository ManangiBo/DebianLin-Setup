Before you macke any changes, go to your home directory and backup the .bashrc file. Note taht all files starting with a `.` are invisibil wit the `ls` command, to list hidden files type `ls -a`. 

after you located your .bashrc file type the following command to make a copy for backup purboses: 
```
cp .bashrc bashrc.backup
```
this step is not necessary but if you unsure about what you are doing a backup is always a good place to go back to if things go wrong.
